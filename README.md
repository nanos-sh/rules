# NanoSIEM Detection Rules

Official detection rule repository for [NanoSIEM](https://nanos.sh). These rules are written in native nPL (nano Pipe Language) format and can be synced directly into your NanoSIEM deployment.

## Usage

Add this repository in NanoSIEM:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Rule Repositories**
2. Click **Add Repository**
3. Enter:
   - **URL**: `https://github.com/nanos-sh/rules`
   - **Branch**: `main`
   - **Format**: NanoSIEM (nPL)
4. Click **Sync** to fetch rules
5. Browse and import rules as needed

```

## Rule Format

Rules use YAML frontmatter with nPL queries:

```yaml
---
title: rule_name
description: What this rule detects
author: author-name
severity: critical|high|medium|low|informational
mode: staging
mitre_tactics: TA0006
mitre_techniques: T1110.001
tags:
  - tag1
  - tag2
---
source_type="logs"
| where condition="value"
| stats count() by field
| where count > threshold
```

## Advanced Features

These rules showcase NanoSIEM's advanced detection capabilities:

### Sequence Detection
Detect ordered event chains (e.g., failed logins → success):
```
| sequence by user maxspan=5m [status="failure"] [status="success"]
```

### Prevalence Filtering
Alert only on rare/new artifacts:
```
| prevalence hash_prevalence < 5 window=7d
```

### Risk-Based Scoring
Dynamic risk calculation based on context:
```
| risk score=if(external_ip, 80, 40) entity=user factor="Login source"
```
